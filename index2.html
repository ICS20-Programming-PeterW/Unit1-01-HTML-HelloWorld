    <H1>Graffiti</H1>
    <p>Another hobie I've picked up recently was graffiti. This started first when I went to paris. In the subways in Paris youll see a lot of graffiti, and through my eyes I thought it looked pretty cool. Ive practiced a lot, but I dont do any graffiti in illegal locations. Most of its just in my basement or on whiteboards in school.
